                <h3>Cryptojacking Attack Detection System</h3>
                <p>
                  Performance data based detection system for real-time
                  cryptojacking attacks in cloud infrastructure.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Cryptomining is the deed of using an individual’s or an
                  organization’s computational power in order to mine
                  cryptocurrency. Doing so without the explicit consent of the
                  computer owners is called cryptojacking, and is considered
                  illegitimate. During previous years, attackers’ focus was
                  heavily laid on browser-based cryptojacking. However, it was
                  noted that the attackers are now shifting their attention to
                  more robust, more superior targets, such as cloud servers and
                  cloud infrastructure. Poorly configured servers and outdated
                  security groundwork has increased mining activities in the
                  cloud.
                </p>
                <span class="expandable-1" id="expandable-1">
                  <p>
                    Existing systems’ detection techniques rely heavily on
                    evasive or exploitable metrics such as the solitary usage of
                    CPU performance or Hardware Performance Counters. A range of
                    evasion techniques are used by attackers to evade such
                    systems: code obfuscation, dead-code injection, proxies and
                    URL randomization, CPU throttling and artificial Hardware
                    Performance Counter manipulation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The proposed system provides a novel detection classifier
                    which can identify cryptojacking attacks in a cloud
                    environment at runtime with near real-time performance. The
                    system will utilize a range of performance variables,
                    dynamically selected to guarantee the metrics has the
                    highest correlation with the attack status. This will ensure
                    the accurate classification of the attack status even within
                    servers with secure high performing applications, workload
                    spikes and stealthily configured miners with low CPU usage.

                  Traditional bill keeping systems come with drawbacks such as
                  inability in keeping recrods of the bills for a longer period

                  splitting and money pooling in their day to day life. Apay
                  bila is a mobile app that acts as a virtual bill wallet to
                  keep track of the bills and helps the users track their daily,
                  weekly and monthly expenses. Additionally, it aids in the bill

                  gameplay, and lack of geographical/physical boundaries and
                  automation of certain functions. However total digitalization
                  of the board games have made the traditional game loose its
                  value in several directions. This includes the feel of the
                  game, or the “magic” as many tradition players call it. The
                  players does not have the same satisfaction they would receive
                  when they physically roll a dice.

                    This project aims to make classic board games a more
                    popular, revolutionized way of gaming, by making the game
                    more interactive through the smart dice. We aim to connect
                    players at a global scale, using multiplayer gaming mode.
                    The dice will not only provide interactivity and the magical
                    feeling of the traditional game, but also provide secure
                    gameplay through fraud detection technology, and
                    international leaderboards.
